## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a weather forecast application, developed according to the 4th Week of Android Dev Challenges with Jetpack Compose.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I love Android development, honestly.
Since Jetpack Compose is a totally different way of thinking in terms of UI building, I decided to take these weekly Android Dev Challenges, as a way to enter in its world.
